    "  \"reasoning\": \"The question of whether Putin will be out as President of Russia by the end of 2025 is clear and unambiguous, with well-defined resolution criteria. However, the current market price suggests a strong belief that he will remain in power, with YES tokens priced at 2.50% and NO tokens at 97.50%. This indicates a low perceived probability of his removal. Recent news primarily focuses on Russia's military actions and geopolitical tensions, which may not directly correlate with Putin's removal from power. The risks include potential manipulation, volatility due to geopolitical events, and the uncertainty surrounding the resolution criteria. There are limited opportunities for profitable trading given the current market sentiment and the lack of significant new information that would change the outlook. Overall, while the market is active, the high NO price suggests a low likelihood of trading success based on the current strategy.\",",
