However, the current market price suggests a low probability of Trump visiting Ukraine, which seems reasonable given the geopolitical context. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the potential risks associated with such a visit create significant uncertainty. The recent news indicates that the situation in Ukraine remains volatile, which could deter Trump from visiting. Additionally, the market sentiment appears to heavily favor 'No', with a 95.5% price for NO tokens. While there may be a slight mispricing given the unpredictable nature of political decisions, the overall risk factors and current events suggest that trading in this market may not be suitable. The risks of manipulation and volatility are moderate, and the potential for resolution issues exists due to the reliance on official sources for confirmation of a visit.\",",
