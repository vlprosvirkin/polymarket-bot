    "  \"reasoning\": \"The question is clear and the resolution criteria are well-defined, focusing on the official launch of a token by Rabby, which must be actively transferable and tradable. However, the current market price suggests a significant belief that the token will not be launched, with a YES price of only 11%. This could indicate either a strong consensus on the likelihood of no launch or potential mispricing if there are signals suggesting a launch. The main risks include uncertainty around Rabby's plans, potential for manipulation given the low liquidity, and the volatility of crypto markets. Opportunities for profit exist if new information suggests a higher likelihood of a launch, but currently, the market sentiment leans heavily towards a NO outcome. The market fits an endgame strategy but may not align with a risk-averse approach due to high uncertainty. More concrete information about Rabby's roadmap and community sentiment would aid in making a better decision.\",",
