The market price for 'Yes' at 87% suggests a strong belief in MegaETH's ability to exceed a $2B FDV within 24 hours of launch. Given the strong pre-launch interest and the reported valuations of up to $6 billion, my estimated probability of 85% indicates a slight edge over the market price. The risks are manageable, but the potential for volatility is high due to the speculative nature of crypto markets. Overall, the market appears suitable for trading.\",",
