    "  \"reasoning\": \"The question is clear and unambiguous, focusing on whether Rabby will launch a token by the end of 2025. The resolution criteria are well-defined, requiring an actual launch of a token that is publicly transferable and tradable, which minimizes ambiguity. The market price shows a significant disparity between the YES and NO options, suggesting potential mispricing. My estimated probability of Rabby launching a token is around 30%, which is considerably higher than the market's YES price of 11%. The main risks include the uncertainty of Rabby's plans, potential delays, or changes in strategy that could affect the launch timeline. However, the market sentiment appears to be overly pessimistic, presenting an opportunity for profit. This market aligns with a high-confidence trading strategy as the resolution date is set, and there is sufficient time to gather more information. Monitoring Rabby's announcements and credible reports will be essential for making informed decisions.\",",
