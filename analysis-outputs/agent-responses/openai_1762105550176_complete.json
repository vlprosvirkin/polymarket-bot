However, the current token prices suggest a significant belief that he will remain in power, with a YES price of 2.50% and a NO price of 97.50%. This indicates that the market is heavily skewed towards the belief that he will not be removed from power. Recent news indicates ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly related to the Ukraine conflict, which could impact Putin's stability but does not provide strong evidence for his imminent removal. The risks of political instability in Russia are present, but the timing and nature of any potential changes in leadership remain highly uncertain. Given the current market sentiment and the lack of clear signals suggesting a shift in this outlook, trading in this market is not advisable.\",",
