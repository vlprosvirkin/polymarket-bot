However, the current market price indicates a significant bias towards the 'No' outcome, suggesting that the market may not be efficiently priced given the potential for Rabby to launch a token. The main risks include the uncertainty surrounding Rabby's plans and the potential for manipulation or misinformation. While there are opportunities for profit if new information emerges, the current sentiment is heavily skewed against a token launch, which may not reflect the actual likelihood. The market fits an endgame strategy, but the risk of volatility and the lack of clear signals make it less attractive for trading at this time.\",",
