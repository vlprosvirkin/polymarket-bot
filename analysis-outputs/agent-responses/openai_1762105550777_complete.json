    "  \"reasoning\": \"The question of whether the US government will hold Bitcoin reserves in 2025 is clear and unambiguous, with well-defined resolution criteria. However, the current market price suggests a strong belief that the US will not hold Bitcoin, with the NO token priced at 90.50%. This indicates a low probability of the event occurring, which may not reflect potential changes in government policy or economic conditions. Recent news highlights growing institutional interest in Bitcoin and discussions around government reserves, particularly in Europe, which could influence US policy. However, the risks of mispricing are high given the speculative nature of cryptocurrency markets and the uncertainty surrounding government actions. The market is currently not suitable for trading as the risk outweighs potential rewards, and the market sentiment is heavily skewed against the possibility of the US holding Bitcoin reserves.\",",
