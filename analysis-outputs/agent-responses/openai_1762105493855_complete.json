However, the current market price suggests a significant belief in his continued leadership, with a 95.5% probability assigned to 'No'. Recent news indicates Netanyahu is actively engaged in military and political issues, which may reinforce his position rather than lead to resignation. The risks include potential manipulation and volatility due to political instability in the region. While there may be opportunities if the political landscape shifts, the current sentiment and news do not provide strong signals for a 'Yes' outcome. Therefore, this market does not align well with an endgame trading strategy focused on imminent changes.\",",
