However, the market prices suggest a significant likelihood of Amanda Edwards not winning, with a 14.5% chance of winning implied by the YES token price. Given that the election is still some time away, this price may not reflect the true probability of her winning, especially considering potential changes in political dynamics, campaign developments, and voter sentiment as the election date approaches. The market has a defined resolution date and criteria, which is positive, but the current pricing indicates a strong bias against her winning, which could be an opportunity if new information emerges that favors her candidacy. The main risks include the volatility of political events leading up to the election, the potential for misinformation, and the possibility of market manipulation given the low liquidity. Overall, while there are potential opportunities, the risks outweigh them at this moment, making it unsuitable for trading.\",",
