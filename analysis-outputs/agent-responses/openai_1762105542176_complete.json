    "  \"reasoning\": \"The question regarding Netanyahu's potential resignation by 2025 is clear and unambiguous, with well-defined resolution criteria. However, the current market price suggests a strong belief that he will not resign, as indicated by the NO token price of 95.50%. Recent news indicates Netanyahu is actively engaged in military operations and political maneuvering, which may strengthen his position rather than weaken it. This creates a perception that he is unlikely to resign. The market appears to be efficient given the current sentiment and news context, but there could be potential mispricing if unexpected political changes occur. The main risks include the potential for political instability or unforeseen events that could prompt a resignation, but the overall sentiment currently leans towards him remaining in power. The market does not fit the endgame trading strategy well, as the likelihood of a resignation seems low based on current information. Therefore, while there are some opportunities, the risks outweigh them significantly.\",",
