However, the current market price indicates a significant belief that Amanda Edwards will not win, with a YES token price at 14.50% and a NO token price at 85.50%. This suggests a strong market sentiment against her candidacy. The market is still active, and there is a defined resolution date, which is good. However, the high NO price indicates that the market may be reflecting a consensus that is difficult to overturn in the short term. The risk factors include potential volatility as the election date approaches and the possibility of unexpected developments in the campaign. There are limited opportunities for profitable trading given the current pricing structure, and the market may not fit an endgame strategy well due to the low likelihood of a significant price movement in the short term.\",",
