However, the current price of YES tokens at 4.50% suggests that the market heavily favors a NO outcome, which may reflect the general sentiment regarding Trump's likelihood of visiting Ukraine given the ongoing conflict and geopolitical tensions. Recent news indicates that the situation in Ukraine remains volatile, with significant military actions and energy infrastructure attacks, making a visit by Trump seem highly unlikely. The risks include potential manipulation of market sentiment based on political developments and the unpredictable nature of Trump's decisions. There are no clear signals suggesting a shift towards a YES outcome, and the market appears to be efficiently priced given the current context. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid trading in this market.\",",
