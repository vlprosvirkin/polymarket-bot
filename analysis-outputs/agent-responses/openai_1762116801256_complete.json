The market resolves on a specific date, and historical data suggests that similar markets have resolved correctly in the past. The current market prices suggest a significant probability of 'No' at 66.35%, which may not fully account for the popularity and marketing strength of 'Wicked: For Good'. Recent news about the stars of the film engaging in promotional activities (getting matching tattoos) could enhance public interest and box office performance. My estimated probability of 'Yes' is around 55%, indicating a potential mispricing as the market suggests a 33.65% chance of 'Yes'.\",",
