The current market price suggests a 33.65% chance of 'Wicked: For Good' having the best opening weekend, which seems undervalued given the popularity of the franchise and the star power of its leads. Recent news about the actors celebrating the film's release could positively influence audience anticipation and turnout. However, there are risks related to competition from other films and potential manipulation. Overall, the market presents a trading opportunity due to the estimated probability being significantly higher than the market price.\",",
